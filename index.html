                    <p>Hello! My name is Alex Bachicha, Alex being short for Alexandra. I was born May 20, 1993 which makes me 27 years old and a Taurus. I live in Sacramento, California with my partner and 3 other roommates. We have a pretty decently sized yard with a garden, 2 chickens, 3 ducks and 3 cats. I graduated from Sacramento State University in 2017 with my Bachelor's in Biology, emphasizing in ecology, conservation and evolution. Currently, I'm working at UC Davis's Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital.
                    </p>

                    <p>I've been working in the veterinary field for the past couple years and while I've enjoyed it, it's hard on my body and the hours are exhausting. I very much enjoy my free time and having more control of my life in a business sense, which prompted me to finally jump the gun and start my search for something new, particularly, in web development. It was a plus that I've always been interested in technology and video games, so I figured why not try to find something that I enjoy doing as a hobby, in addition to work.
                    I had randomly stumbled upon information about this bootcamp. One thing led to another, and now here I am. The world of web development is entirely new to me, but so far I have enjoyed every minute of it. One thing I've already learned? Frustration is the key to success.
