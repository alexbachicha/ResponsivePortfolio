# ResponsivePortfolio

This project involved utilizing a Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio.
Some of the main points of interest in the portfolio include:
    A navbar
    A responsive layout
    Responsive images
It also minimizes the use of media  queries.


I found this project to be quite difficult. It challenged me in my creative abilities and problem solving capabilties. I think my project couid have used a lot more work, but I'm proud of what I accomplished so far.
